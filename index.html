<p>This book is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in the computer.
‘‘I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When
it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and
then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really
were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I
think we’re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the
house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don’t
become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already.
What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful
computing is only in your hands. What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to
see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.’’
Alan J. Perlis (April 1, 1922-February 7, 1990)</p>
